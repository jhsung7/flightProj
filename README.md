### 1. Dataset
- Flight Delay and Cancellation Dataset 2019-2023 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023?select=flights_sample_3m.csv)
  - Since the file size is too big to upload in Github, please download the file from the kaggle and run the code. Thank you!


### 2. Explanation of each column in the dataset

            - DOT_CODE: DOT identifier.
          FL_NUMBER: Flight number.
          ORIGIN: Origin airport code.
            - ORIGIN_CITY: City of origin airport.
          DEST: Destination airport code.
            - DEST_CITY: City of destination airport.
          CRS_DEP_TIME: Scheduled departure time.
          DEP_TIME: Actual departure time.
          DEP_DELAY: Departure delay.
          TAXI_OUT: Time spent taxiing out.
            - WHEELS_OFF: Time when aircraft's wheels leave the ground.
            - WHEELS_ON: Time when aircraft's wheels touch the ground.

          ARR_TIME: Actual arrival time.
          ARR_DELAY: Arrival delay.
          CANCELLED: Indicator if the flight was cancelled (1 for cancelled, 0 for not cancelled).
            - CANCELLATION_CODE: Reason for cancellation (if applicable).
          DIVERTED: Indicator if the flight was diverted (1 for diverted, 0 for not diverted).

          DISTANCE: Distance traveled.
          DELAY_DUE_CARRIER: Delay due to carrier.
          DELAY_DUE_WEATHER: Delay due to weather.
          DELAY_DUE_NAS: Delay due to National Airspace System (NAS).
          DELAY_DUE_SECURITY: Delay due to security.
          DELAY_DUE_LATE_AIRCRAFT: Delay due to late aircraft arrival.
